# Data-Without-the-Degree-Arcade-
I'm thrilled to have completed the "Data Without Degree" arcade by Google Cloud Skills Boost! It was a fantastic experience that taught me a lot about data analysis, machine learning, and cloud computing.  
Throughout the arcade, I learned the basics of data science, including how to analyze and visualize data using Python, how to use machine learning algorithms to make predictions, and how to store and manage data using cloud services.One of the highlights of the arcade was the practical projects that allowed me to apply what I learned in real-world scenarios. 
I also learned how to use Google Cloud Platform to store and manage large datasets, which has been incredibly useful in my work as a data analyst.
The skills I learned have allowed me to take on more challenging projects and have opened up new opportunities for me in the field of data science. I'm excited to continue exploring this field and to see where these skills take me next.
